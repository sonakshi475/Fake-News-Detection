# 📰 Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

This project identifies whether a news article is **real or fake** based on its textual content. It uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques and a machine learning model to classify articles. The goal is to combat misinformation by providing an automated way to verify news authenticity.

## 🔍 Project Overview

- **Objective**: Build a model that can detect fake news using a labeled dataset.
- **Approach**: Preprocess the data, convert text to numerical form using TF-IDF, and train a Logistic Regression model.
- **Result**: Achieved ~92% accuracy in classifying news articles.

## 🧠 Key Features

- Cleans and preprocesses news text (stopwords, punctuation, stemming).
- Converts textual data to feature vectors using TF-IDF.
- Trains and evaluates a supervised ML model.
- Outputs performance metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix.
